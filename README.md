# Trash__Hack

During a hackathon, our team developed an innovative waste management initiative aimed at promoting environmental cleanliness within schools and communities. We created a web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging the Bootstrap framework to ensure a responsive and user-friendly design. Our platform is designed to facilitate the efficient collection and recycling of waste from schools and dumping sites, providing real-time updates and a wealth of educational resources.

By fostering collaboration and raising awareness, our project encourages sustainable practices and strengthens community engagement in maintaining a clean environment. We believe that by empowering individuals and communities with the right tools and information, we can collectively make a significant impact on environmental hygiene and sustainability.
